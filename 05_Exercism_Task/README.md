# JavaScript Learning Mode – Exercism

This repository contains my solutions from the **JavaScript Learning Mode** on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/concepts).

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey, strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals, and practice writing clean, readable, and well-structured code.

##  What I Learned

During this track, I practiced and improved my understanding of:

- JavaScript basics (variables, functions, conditionals)
- Data types and type checking
- Arrays and objects
- Error handling
- Classes and modules
- Clean code and readability
- Problem-solving using JavaScript
