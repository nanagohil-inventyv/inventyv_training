# JavaScript Task 

##  Task Overview

###  01_Task
This task focuses on  `Array` and its related Methods like `shift()` and `unshift()`  and also `rest operator`
and `Promise` object

#### Concepts Covered:
- `Array`
- `Function`
- `Promise`
- `Promise.then() and catch()`
- `Rest Operator(...)`

#### Example Problem:
- you have to defined the two function `fun1` and `fun2` The `fun1`
- work of `fun1()`
  - Defined Array of Number 
  - Remove the First Element
  - Call the `fun2()` with arguments `first element` and `array`
  - also handle the `Promise`  which retured by `fun2()`

- work of `fun2()`
  - defined the second array
  - append the` first element` at the front of the `second array`
  - append the `first array `at the end of the `second array`
  - create a `promise` object, if the **total sum** of second array is **greater than 35** then `Resolve` the    Promise otherwise the `Reject` the Promise.

### 02_Task

#### Concepts Covered:
- `loops`
- `Bitwise Operators`

#### Example Problem:
> given the input number n and print  the pattern `for  n = 5` 

```
1 1 1 1 1 
1 2 2 2 1 
1 2 3 2 1 
1 2 2 2 1 
1 1 1 1 1 
```

### 03_Task

#### Concepts Covered:
- `Array`
- `Function`
- `Promise`
- `Promise.then() and catch()`
- `Rest Operator(...)`
- `Symbol` 
    - `Symbol` is a built-in object whose constructor returns a `symbol primitiv`e — also called a Symbol value or just a Symbol — that's guaranteed to be **unique**. Symbols are often used to add **unique property** keys to an object that won't collide with keys any other code might add to the object, and which are hidden from any mechanisms other code will typically use to access the object

#### Example Problem:
> Do `Task 01`  using the `Symbol` Datatype.
